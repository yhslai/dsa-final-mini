Givat Yoav (Hebrew:  ) is an Israeli settlement, moshav, located in the southern Golan Heights, under the administration of Israel. The settlement was built in the 1968s. It falls under the municipal jurisdiction of the Golan Regional Council. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.[1] On a dairy farm in Givat Yoav, a seven-year-old cow named Shikufit set a record for milk production in 2004, topping the average annual yield of 11,000 liters by an additional 8,000, producing nearly 19,000 liters of milk. Garmer Mosha Sofer attributed the production to the personal attention and individual care that she gives each of the cows in her herd.[2]   
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org.
