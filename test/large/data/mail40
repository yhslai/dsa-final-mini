The music video for 'What's It Gonna Be' is set in a school. Its about a girl that likes a boy but she doesn't know whether he likes her back or not because he always seems so interested in a blonde girl. Throughout the video you see the main singers in a library for a few seconds singing their part. The rest of the video is set in the classroom. It seems a lesson is going on and a boring one at that, the boy falls asleep and dreams that the blonde girl smiles at him gets out of her seat and starts dancing in her red lace underwear tie and open shirt. Suddenly the boy wakes up and the teacher appears to be doing the same sexy dance, then the teacher is shouting at him for falling asleep. It goes to what seems to be the end of the day, all the students are somewhere in the school no longer in uniform, the girl seems to be expressing her feelings for the boy to his face. Suddenly the doors open and the blonde walks up to him, she wants him to go with her but he blows her off to stay with the other girl.
