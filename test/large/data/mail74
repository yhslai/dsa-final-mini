Sonelal Patel, an associate of Kanshi Ram, was one of the founders of the Bahujan Samaj Party, but developed differences with Mayawati and formed his own party in the early 2000s. In 2002 mafia don turned politician[1] Atiq Ahmed won in the state elections from Allahabad[2]. However, the Party failed to win any seats in the Indian general election, 2009 or Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, 2007. In October 2009, Sone Lal Patel died in a car crash and the future of the party became uncertain[3].

The party tied up with other smaller groups such as the Peace Party of India.
