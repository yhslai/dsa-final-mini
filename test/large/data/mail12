Carlos K. McClatchy (March 25, 1927-April 16, 1989) was called C.K. McClatchy, as had been his grandfather, Charles Kenny McClatchy. This second C.K. was a son of Carlos McClatchy, first editor of The Fresno Bee.[1] He became president of McClatchy Newspapers upon the death of his aunt, Eleanor McClatchy in 1979. Over the next decade, until his own death, he guided the family-owned media company on a course that led toward The McClatchy Company, a major, nationwide newspaper chain.[2] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org.
