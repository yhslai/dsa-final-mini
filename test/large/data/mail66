6 carriages per trainset The Hammersmith & City line is a subsurface London Underground line. It connects Hammersmith in the west with Barking in the east, running through the northern part of central London. It is coloured salmon pink on the Tube map. It was formerly part of the Metropolitan line and incorporates the oldest underground railway in the world, the section between Paddington and Farringdon, opened on 10 January 1863. The original Hammersmith & City line opened on 13 June 1864, although Hammersmith station itself moved to a different location in 1868. With the exception of the two-stop Waterloo & City line and the East London Line (now a London Overground service), it has been the least-used line on the Underground. It ranks 10th of the 11 lines in passenger numbers. Out of the 29 stations served, 10 have Hammersmith & City line platforms that are wholly or almost wholly below ground, all in cut-and-cover, while those at Paddington, Edgware Road, Farringdon, Barbican and Whitechapel are in cuttings, or under train-sheds but below street level. Between Hammersmith and a point between Ladbroke Grove and Westbourne Park stations, the line is an elevated railway built on brick viaducts. Since December 2009 the route between Hammersmith and Edgware Road has been served also by Circle line trains. With this change, the Hammersmith & City line no longer has any stations unique to it. The Hammersmith and City Railway (H&CR) opened in 1864, a 5km (3.1mi) elevated railway, largely built on brick arches and bridges between a station at Hammersmith and Westbourne Park that was operated jointly by the Metropolitan and Great Western Railways. The section between Paddington and Farringdon, the world's first underground railway had opened the previous year in 1863.[2] Aldgate was reached in 1876, and the line was electrified in 1906.[3] The line was run with joint stock until the Metropolitan Railway became part of London Underground in 1934 and the line became a branch of the Metropolitan line. The District line was congested east of Whitechapel on the line to Barking, so from 1936 some Metropolitan Hammersmith & City line trains were extended to Barking,[4] diverted from the East London line. For two years from 1939 the 8-car Uxbridge line trains were extended from Aldgate but this caused operational problems, and from 1941 Barking was again served by Hammersmith & City trains.[5] In November 1939, through trains to the East London line via St Mary's curve were withdrawn.[4] The joint Met&GW stock on the Hammersmith & City line, dating from 1905, was replaced by O stock that initially operated in 4- and 6-car formations, entering service from 1937.[5] However, the trains were made up entirely of motor cars and this caused a problem with the electrical supply, so trailer cars were added from 1938.[6] In 1968 an order was placed for 35 six-car trains to replace this stock. These were arranged as two units with a driving cab in the motor car at one end only, and were normally run as three pairs. These trains were designated C69 stock.[7] The line has been shown separately on Tube maps since 1988, though in later years it was usually operated as a separate line, with the sections not used by regular Metropolitan line trains (from Hammersmith to Baker Street and from Liverpool Street to Barking) not included on the main Metropolitan line maps. Also the line used C Stock as opposed to the A Stock used on the Metropolitan main line. Because the name change of the route to the separate identity of the Hammersmith & City line is relatively recent, there are many stations with tiling or enamel maps that still show that they are served by the Metropolitan line, e.g. Bromley-by-Bow station, shared by the H&C and the District line. All Hammersmith & City line trains are in the distinctive London Underground livery of red, white and blue and are the larger of the two sizes used on the network. These 6-car trains comprise C stock, introduced 196970, with a further batch in 1978. The line shares this fleet with the Circle and District (Wimbledon-Edgware Road branch) lines. LUL says these 40-year-old trains, part of the same fleet that also operates the Circle line, are "in an increasingly poor state",[8] and they are to be replaced with new seven-car S stock air-conditioned trains from Bombardier Transportation,[9] with delivery scheduled to begin in 2012 for completion by the end of 2014. In combination with new signalling (see below), this is expected to produce an eventual overall increase in the capacity of the route of up to 65%.[10] To accommodate these longer trains (117m long as opposed to 93m for C stock), station platforms are currently being lengthened.[9] There is one depot, Hammersmith,map 30 close to Hammersmith station. However, that depot can do only minor work, and other work is carried out at Neasden Depot. There are also sidings at Barking, Farringdon and near High Street Kensington (known as Triangle Sidings) for stabling trains overnight. Trains are also stabled at Lillie Bridge Depot.[1]map 31 LUL intends to award a contract in 2012 to build a single signal control centre for the whole of the sub-surface network (Circle, Metropolitan, and Hammersmith & City lines). Some of the existing signalling dates from before the Second World War and it has become unreliable, with replacement components often unavailable. A new system will be installed with automatic train operation (ATO), which it is hoped will be fully working by 2018,[10] increasing throughput in the central area from 27 trains per hour to 32 trains per hour.[8] Map of the line. There are intermediate stations on the line at which trains can terminate. In normal use these are Edgware Road, Baker Street, King's Cross and Moorgate. Additionally[citation needed] Liverpool Street, Aldgate East, Bromley-by-Bow, West Ham, Plaistow and East Ham may be used. Map of first 200 coordinates from Bing in order from west to east Between Hammersmith and Edgware Road, the service was supplemented by Circle line trains from 13 December 2009, when that route changed from its previous orbital route. This was intended to cause fewer delays since, under the previous Circle line arrangements, one delayed train would affect all following trains. LUL claimed that having a terminus at Edgware Road, rather than the continuous orbital route, would avoid this. The Hammersmith & City line continues to run as a separate entity, with trains running to Barking and Plaistow in the east. The headway on the Hammersmith  Edgware Road leg has been reduced from seven to four minutes by this schedule change,[11] and the alternation of Hammersmith & City with Circle trains now in principle provide 12 trains per hour at peak times on this section, doubling the previous frequency.
