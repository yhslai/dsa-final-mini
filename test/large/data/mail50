 Andantino, originally titled Pas de Deux, is a ballet made for New York City Ballet's Tschaikovsky Festival by balletmaster Jerome Robbins to the second movement of the composer's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor, Op. 23 (1875). The premiere took place on June 4, 1981, at New York State Theater, Lincoln Center with costumes by Ben Benson and lighting by Ronald Bates.
