SEVEN Networks, Inc. is a privately funded American corporation founded in 2000. Headquartered in Redwood City, CA,[1] SEVEN develops and markets a push-based software platform and applications, which include SEVEN Mobile Messaging Applications, Push Notifications and Open Channel.[2] Operating on a wide range of mobile devices (from feature phones to smartphones), SEVEN provides solutions for wireless operators, content providers, and device manufacturers with software for mobile traffic optimization and real-time messaging. The company has research and development centers around the globe, including a facility in Estonia and a green data center in the Bay Area and employs about 265 employees worldwide.[3] SEVEN mobile messaging products are turnkey multi-device, multi-service solutions that enable operators and device manufacturers to simplify the delivery of services across a broad device portfolio while optimizing traffic on their network. Unique to SEVEN applications is their ability to deliver a desktop-like experience for core messaging applications like email, IM and social networking.[4] The company was formerly known as Leap Corporation and changed its name to SEVEN Networks, Inc. in December 2000.[5] In 2004 the company was selected as part of FierceWireless' annual list of "The Fierce 15," which recognizes the 15 most promising and innovative wireless startups of the year.[6] In 2006, the company announced Sprint as a customer.[7] Since then, the company has expanded its product portfolio to include support for a broad range of email services globally, added mobile instant messaging to its application portfolio, and expanded its platform with analytics, applications and social networking for a number of customers worldwide. In 2010, the company announced that it was selected by Samsung Electronics to provide push technology for Samsung Social Hub, a social networking and integrated messaging solution that will be available worldwide on several of the companys bada and Android handsets.[8] As of January 2010, the company claimed in a press release to have more than eight million accounts[9] actively synchronized on mobile devices using SEVEN.[10] In early 2011, the company announced Verizon Wireless as a customer[11] and also announced its Open Channel traffic optimization software, which claims to cuts the data consumption of smartphones and other mobile devices by up to 70 percent.[12] Open Channel was launched in February 2011 in order to help carriers manage the impact of push messaging notifications on their networks. It works by monitoring all requests for data from smartphone applications, like Facebook, email, Twitter and others, which make up to hundreds of requests per hour, with only a small fraction of them actually returning data.[13] The platform instead acts as a buffer in the network, determining when content for a particular app is available and then allowing the phone to go out and get that content.[14] According to early tests, the solution can help mobile devices reduce their time on a network by up to 40 percent and help reduce mobile traffic by up to 70 percent while boosting battery life by up to 25 percent.[15] Open Channel is transparent to connected applications and requires no changes or special integration by mobile developers. Additionally, it does not require changes to the network and can work in conjunction with new standards for fast network dormancy, smart signaling and other network optimizations.[16] In February 2011, Open Channel received the GSMA Global Mobile Award (which recognizes excellence, achievement and innovation within the mobile communications industry[17]) for Best Mobile Technology Breakthrough.[18] The firm works with mobile platform providers, device manufacturers, email messaging solutions and providers of services in the cloud, and infrastructure partners, to sell mobile messaging services. Its systems run on commonly deployed mobile platforms including Android,[19] bada, BREW,[20] J2ME,[21] Symbian and Windows Mobile.[22] They work on products from device manufacturers, including: HTC, INQ, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Sanyo, Samsung, and Sony Ericsson; and are embedded on more than 550 device types.[23] The firm has partnered with many of the top Internet Service Providers including Google, Microsoft (Exchange and Windows Live) and Yahoo!,[citation needed] and infrastructure providers such as Equinix,[24] Savvis and Oracle.
