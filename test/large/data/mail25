Nolle is a 2007 drama film written, produced, and directed by David Wall who also stars as Father Jonathan Keene, a Catholic priest who comes to a small American fishing village in the Christmas season to shut down a dying parish, only to experience a personal transformation as he encounters the eccentric townspeople. Shot on location on Cape Cod, Nolle was originally produced under the title Mrs. Worthington's Party by Volo Films (David Wall's production banner) and won two awards at the 2006 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival for Best Director and Best American Indie 1st Runner Up. The film was picked up for commercial distribution by Gener8Xion Entertainment and was released in theaters on December 7, 2007. Father Jonathan Keene comes to a small fishing village a week before Christmas to shut down a dying parish. But when he encounters the lives of the people who populate this village, Keene undergoes a transformation of the heart, which culminates with a revelation of Keene's secret past at the town's legendary Mrs. Worthington's Christmas Party. Writer-producer-director-actor David Wall drew inspiration for Nolle when he was living on Cape Cod where an annual Christmas party was held at an "old whaling captain's house" that was "down the street" from Wall's home where people from varying socio-economic-religious backgrounds gathered, "celebrating one thing -- Christmas." Nolle was filmed on 35mm film and features the cinematography of Beecher Cotton who "does justice to the stark beauty of the Cape." Nolle features some Cape Cod landmarks such as the Cape Cod Hospital, the Sandwich Boardwalk, an East Dennis library, the beaches of Dennis Port, a church in Yarmouth Port, and a restaurant on Route 28 in West Dennis. Nolle was released in theaters nation-wide on 203 screens on December 7, 2007 by Gener8Xion Entertainment. The release strategy involved targeting Gener8Xion's audiences in major markets across the country with the film being screened in the best performing theaters from Gener8Xion's previous theatrical released film One Night with the King.
