Insight Communications Limited is one of the largest advertising agencies in West Africa.[1] It is wholly owned by the Troyka Group and is a member of the Grey Group EMEA. Insight Communications Limited was incorporated in 1979 and commenced operations in 1980 as an integrated marketing communications outfit. Today, Insight Communications is positioned in billings, processes and systems and manpower development. Business processes in the company are built on the "3-I model" of Information, Inspiration and Imagination. The process begins with the gathering and analyzing of all necessary information, followed by the integration of this information with the key objectives of each campaign.
