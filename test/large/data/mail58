Porter is a large-scale impact crater in the Thaumasia quadrangle on the planet Mars, situated in Aonia Terra at 50.8 south and 113.9 west. The impact caused a bowl 105 kilometres (65mi) across. The name was chosen in 1973 by the International Astronomical Union in honour of the US astronomer and explorer, Russell W. Porter (1871-1949).[1]
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org.
