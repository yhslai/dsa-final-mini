Butabika is a location in south-eastern Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. Butabika is bordered by Bweyogerere to the north, Kirinnya, a Ward in Kira Municipality to the east, Luzira and Port Bell to the south, Mutungo to the west and Kireka in Kira Municipality to the northwest. This location is approximately 12 kilometres (7.5mi), by road, east of Kampala's central business district.[1] The coordinates of Butabika are:00 19 12N, 32 39 27E (Latitude:0.3200; Longitude:32.6575). Butabika is approximately 1,180 metres (3,870ft) above sea level. Butabika is the location of the largest mental health hospital in Uganda, with an estimated bed capacity of 900. Butabika National Referral Hospital is the country's only referral hospital specializing in mental health. Prior to 2005, the hospital owned the entire area consisting of over 300 acres (120ha). In 2005, about half of that land was sold to private individuals and institutional developers. One of those developers is Nationwide Properties, a subsidiary of Mukwano Group. Nationwide is constructing a housing estate of 1,400 upscale housing units on 150 acres (61ha) of prime land, adjacent to Lake Victoria, slated for completion in 2011.[2][3] The landmarks at or near Butabika include: Coordinates: 001912N 323927E / 0.32N 32.6575E / 0.32; 32.6575
