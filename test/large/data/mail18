The Silversmith Hotel & Suites is a boutique hotel located in downtown Chicago, Illinois, USA. Managed by Remington Hotels Inc., the hotel occupies the historic Silversmith Building. In the late 1890s, the Arts and Crafts Movement began to replace Romanesque Revival architecture. In 1896, Peter J. Weber, of the architectural firm of D.H. Burnham and Company, designed the Silversmith to reflect this transition. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[2] The hotel features 143 guest rooms, including 63 suites, and offers guests a wide variety of lodging choices all under one roof. One thing all of our accommodations have in common-comfort, space, and a sense of style that takes its cue from arts-and-crafts design, the perfect marriage of form with function. All our Chicago hotel rooms and suites are equipped with amenities including complimentary Wi-Fi, in-room safes that accommodate laptops, premium cable TV, spacious bathrooms, comfortable work desks, and CD players. The Silversmith Hotel & Suites is located in downtown Chicago at 10 South Wabash Ave., 17 miles from O'Hare International Airport, 11 miles from Midway Airport. [3]
